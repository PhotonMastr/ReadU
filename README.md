# ReadU
An extremely simple cat clone written in C 



<h1>How to install!</h1>

<p>Please note that ReadU isn't on Windows yet and probably won't ever be</p>

<p> First, clone this repository to your system using </p>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/photonmastr/ReadU
```

<p> Then run </p>

```sh
cd ReadU
```

<p> Now you are in the directory of the files! To install, first note what shell you're on. If you're on bash, run 

```sh
./Install-bash.sh
```
<p> If you're on ZSH, run </p>

```sh
./Install-zsh.sh
```
<p> And if you're on Fish run </p>

```sh
./Install-fish.sh
```

if these don't work, make sure the shell script is chmod'd with 
```sh
chmod +x Install-[insert shell name here].sh
```


and now to run it simply type ReadU in your terminal!

Yes, I know it's basic right now but trust me more is coming in the future. Thank you for even downloading it!


Yes, ConvertU and ReadU end with U's, future software I make will end with U's as like a trademark of mine
